doubt is a beautiful, yet tiresome feeling. to doubt ones self is to estrange the corpse of all semblance of normality,
in the name of trying to provide an answer between two idealist truths. the first step in doubting is to determine the canonical 
fabric of contradiction. this can be a material fact, such as that of physical properities that inhabit our lives, or it can be a stream of consciousness.

st. augustine of hippo understood doubt better than most, at least in my view. "si fallor, sum" (if i am mistaken, i exist).
the existence of doubt in our heads proves our existence. descartes, not being fully convinced took it a little further. 
can any truth exist if you doubt everything in existence? what if nothing can be seen as "veritas" (truth). the same conclusion must be reached.
"cogito, ergo sum" (i think therefore i am). if you were to doubt everything in existence—every blade of grass, the smell of air, the fact that you were born, 
the natural laws that govern our world, your own intution—you would still reach the same conclusion. the only thing you cannot doubt is your ability to doubt,
thus bringing us to a fundamental truth: some form of us exists, at the very least to doubt the fact that we exist.
<br />
doubt, then, is no adversary of truth, but its solemn gatekeeper; 
for if consciousness alone withstands our denial, then to doubt is already to bear witness to our being.
in our fragile persistence lies our first and final proof: we are here, if only to question.
