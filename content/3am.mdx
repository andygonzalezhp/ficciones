it's 3am and i can't fall asleep and it feels as though the last little bits of the world
 inside of me have all burned up and dispersed into the air. 
 what do i do with my life is the question of many but nonetheless me as well. 
 all i can do for now is wander. supposedly, if you wander around in an open field enough you are bound to crash into a tree. 
 that's kinda what i'm hoping for.
