today i skipped breakfast. actually, to start off correctly, i skipped waking up early. i skipped class.
i skipped an event on campus i was looking forward too. i skipped answering my mom's messages and calls.
i skipped going to the bar with some friends. i skipped doing homework. i skipped washing my clothes. i skipped taking a shower. 
i skipped eating dinner. i skipped excersing. i skipped rocks. i skipped school to go to █████████ and skip rocks.

<br /> when will it stop? i want to skip the act of skipping everything. but it appears that i am going to skip that too.
